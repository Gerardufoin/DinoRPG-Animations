# DinoRPG: Animations

This project is a recreation of the [Dino-RPG](http://www.dinorpg.com/) game Flash files into Javacript using [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/).

The compiled script combines the Flash files fight.swf, gfx.swf, sdino.swf, dino.swf, and smonsters.swf.

You can see the final product used on my other repository hosting the legacy version of the Paradino Cinema: [Dino-RPG: Legacy Paradino](https://github.com/Gerardufoin/DinoRPG-Legacy-Paradino).

The documentation for the fight format can be found in the fight's [README](https://github.com/Gerardufoin/DinoRPG-Animations/tree/main/src/fight)

The following pages allow to test the result for the different parts of the project:

-   [sdino.swf](https://gerardufoin.github.io/DinoRPG-Animations/public/sdino.html): The small animated version of the Dinoz.
-   [dino.swf](https://gerardufoin.github.io/DinoRPG-Animations/public/dino.html): The big static portrait of the Dinoz.
-   [smonsters.swf](https://gerardufoin.github.io/DinoRPG-Animations/public/smonster.html): All the monsters which can be fought in the game.
-   [fight.swf](https://gerardufoin.github.io/DinoRPG-Animations/public/fight.html): A few example of the final product with all parts combined.

A comparison of the Dinoz' display with their Flash equivalent can be found [here](https://gerardufoin.github.io/DinoRPG-Animations/public/compare.html), but do note that you will need a plugin like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) to be able to run the Flash files.
