# DinoRPG-Animations

Convert the DinoRPG game SWF files into javacript using PixiJS.

The ultimate aim of the project is the recreation in Javascript of the fight.swf file of the online game [DinoRPG](http://www.dinorpg.com/).

To reach this step, the following SWF files will have to be converted first:

-   sdino.swf: Small animated version of the dinos.
-   dino.swf: Big version of the dinos, needed for portraits and skill casting.
-   smonsters.swf: Small animated version of the monsters
-   gfx.swf: Attacks and effects

Each steps of the project should ideally be able to be instantiated as standalone if needed.

## Current status

The project is still in its infancy, on the conversion of the sdino.swf file.

The file is comprised of the following entities:

-   bad (done)
-   moueffe (done)
-   pigmou (done)
-   winks (in progress)
-   planaile
-   castivore
-   rocky
-   pteroz
-   nuagoz
-   sirain
-   hippoclamp
-   gorilloz
-   wanwan
-   santaz
-   feross
-   kabuki
-   mahamuti
-   soufflet
-   toufufu
-   quetzu
-   smog
-   triceragnon

You can see a (messy) test version for sdino.swf if you have a dino code to test [here](https://gerardufoin.github.io/DinoRPG-Animations/public/sdino.html).
